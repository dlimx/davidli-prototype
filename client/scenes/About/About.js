          My name is David (Min Xiao) Li. I am a recent graduate of McGill
          University, with a Bachelor of Science in Honours Biochemistry. I am
          currently residing in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. On a day-to-day
          basis, I am often found studying at a local library or caf√©. Some of
          my hobbies include writing, piano, and beach volleyball. If you're
          looking for a studying friend or an adventuring partner, I am always
          open.
